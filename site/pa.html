        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fast-forward a few decades, the movement of<i> pop art</i> would take form in the US and UK during the<i> late 1950s </i>in response to the lack of cultural relevance that traditional fine arts had in the newly changing   post-world war II era.  In similar aspects of<b> dadaism movement</b>, the pop art movement made art out of simple everyday objects or famous figures found within culture. Pop art borrowed objects and people from essentially any source, recontextualized them, and then distributed them as accessible piece of art for everyone to take part in on a mass scale, connecting high and low art, showcasing the wonder, value, humor, foolishness, relatability that can be found and shared in everyday life.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About a century ago, in the<i> early 1900s</i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Duchamp" target="_blank" style="color:black" > Marcel Duchamp </a> was an artist associated with the<a href="https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dadaism" target="_blank" style="color:black" > Dadaism movement</a>, which was a movement of art that expressed the early idea that the world is without reason, but rather, it is irrational and absurd. <i>In 1917</i> Duchamp created an art piece called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_(Duchamp)" target="_blank" style="color:black" >Fountain</a>” ,<i><b> which was essentially just a urinal he purchased from a plumbing store</b></i>. At first it was rejected when he attempted to exhibit it as art, but after some time, it would become accepted and redeemed as<i> an ingenious and highly influential piece</i>. In these piece, Duchamp put the question of what art could be, and whether or not it had to be made by the artist or if it could be merely re-contextualization or an addition of what already existed.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arguably , memes are just another<i> evolution of art</i> that serves to satisfy our human need to <i>share, express,  and derive connection from our problems, perspectives, sadness’s and experiences</i>, in a world where it is increasingly hard to do so in traditional ways. Like <u>art movements of the past</u>, memes are <u><i><b>a reflection of the modern world’s condition</b></i></u>.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of the internet and social media has made us wanting things faster, easier and more direct than<b> ever</b>. Essentially, memes are art without the<i> mystique</i> and without the barrier to entry. Where instead of hiding the point,<u> it literally writes it on itself</u>. Where instead of requiring <i>aesthetics</i> or  <i>traditional craft</i>, it merely requires <u>some amount of honesty</u>,<u>  humor</u>, <u><i>and access to the internet</i></u>. Where instead of an exclusiviti in the sharing of media in a mass scale just about everyone can participate and experience moments of fame and virality. In<i> 1968</i> , world famous pop artist <a href="https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Warhol" target="_blank" style="color:black"><i>Andy Warhole</i></a> accurately predicted when saying: <i>In the future everybody will be world famous for fifteen minutes<i>.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like art of the past, memes serv to provide us with a <u><i>conduit or a connection point</i></u>, through which we can engage in and share our cultural and human experiences in a way that is creative. Like art, memes can show us the<i> absurdity and funniness</i> of our existence. <u>The things we should pay attention to</u>,<u> the things we should critique about ourselves and our culture</u>. And how foolish, interesting, dark, beautiful, confused, scared, and similar we often are in even the simplest components of our lives.
